# The Formatted Text Control for Xojo

## Brief History
This is the Formatted Text Control for Xojo.  Originally created by Bob Keeney, it was eventually purchased and released as open-source by Dr. Brian R. Gaines. [Please forward me
corrections or elaborations on this information for historical records. --MRT]

## Going Forward
Dr. Gaines and myself (Michael Taylor) hope to form an open-source community around this important Xojo control to maintain it and improve it over time.

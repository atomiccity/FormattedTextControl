# The Formatted Text Control for Xojo

## Brief History
This is the Formatted Text Control for Xojo.  Originally, it was created by Brendan Murphy.  Eventually, he sold it to Bob Keeney.  Most recently, it was purchased and released as open-source by Dr. Brian R. Gaines.  Thank you for this wonderful control for Xojo!  _[Please forgive me if I've left anyone out.  I'm only familiar with the recent history.  If I've left you out, please forward me your details.  --MRT]_

## Going Forward
Dr. Gaines and myself (Michael Taylor) hope to form an open-source community around this important Xojo control to maintain it and improve it over time.
